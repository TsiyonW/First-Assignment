# First-Assignment
I have used pipe and filter and event driven architecture for my apps.
1.  For the exam app(console) there are steps that should communicate to its intermidiate
    so I used pipe and filter first the questions are read from the database using the Reader class
    then sends the questions to Shuffler class so the questions are shuffled then those question should be
    displayed so the displayer class will display the questions.

2. The second one is event driven phone book that depends on the occuring events(changes in the state).
